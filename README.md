## Team
This is a collaborative effort of group 7 (Kritagya Kumra, Aakash Chavan, Daniel Macias, Janvi Navdiya, and Jaswant Reddy Bota.

## Objective
The aim of this notebook is to implement and train an agent on the game of Connect 4 using Minimax Algorithm. We aim to explore how well Minimax can adapt and optimize its gameplay in the context of Connect 4.

## Methodology
1. **Game engine**: Implement a Connect 4 game engine to facilitate the interaction of the agent with the game environment.
2. **Neural network**: Design a deep neural network model to approximate both policy (best moves) and value (winning chances) functions.
3. **Self-play**: Utilize Minimax guided by the neural network to generate self-play data. The agent plays against itself to explore the game tree.
4. **Training**: Update the neural network weights based on the outcomes and search probabilities obtained during self-play.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained neural network's ability to recognize critical game states, such as immediate wins or blocks as a performance heuristic.


## This Branch contains the report for the Entire Project with the notebook containing the entire model.
